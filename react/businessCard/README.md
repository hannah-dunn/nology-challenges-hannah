# Challenge

MVP
Create a Digital Business Card generator
Use a form to collect some details about a user (name, email, whatever else)
The form should submit this data, and save it into state somewhere
On the same page, create a component that represents a business card (style this appropriately)
The data from the form should load into the business card
Form Component and Business Card Component should be seperate
Practice lifting state/prop drilling
BONUS:
Add support for images
Use file input field, figure out how to temporarily render the image, and render that in the business card
Hint: Probably will need FormData
Try it all three ways
